# PresentaPulse v1.0.1

**Release Date:** November 26, 2025

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Critical Fix
- **Fixed ImportError on startup** (#2)
  - Created missing `src/utils/video.py` module
  - Added `VideoEnhancer` class for basic video processing
  - Added `has_audio_stream()` and `exec_cmd()` utility functions
  - Application now starts successfully without import errors

### Details
The application was failing to start with:
```
ImportError: cannot import name 'VideoEnhancer' from 'src.utils.video'
```

This has been resolved by creating the missing module with all required exports. The `VideoEnhancer` class provides a fallback implementation for frame enhancement when the enhanced version is not available.

## 📦 Installation

No changes to installation process. Existing installations should work after updating.

## 🔄 Upgrade Instructions

1. Pull the latest changes:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. Verify the new files exist:

   ls src/utils/video.py
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   ./run.bat  # Windows
   # or

   ```

## 📝 Files Changed

- ✅ `src/utils/video.py` (new)
- ✅ `src/__init__.py` (new)
- ✅ `src/utils/__init__.py` (new)

## 🔧 Technical Details

The `src/utils/video.py` module provides:
- **VideoEnhancer class**: Basic frame enhancement using Real-ESRGAN
- **has_audio_stream()**: Audio stream detection using ffprobe
- **exec_cmd()**: Command execution with progress tracking

This module serves as a fallback when enhanced video processing modules are not available, ensuring the application can always start and provide basic functionality.
